      <h2>Project Overview</h2>  
      <div>
      <h3>Goal</h3>
      <p>Redesign the USDA website navigation and organization systems to improve the ability of the average user to find the information they are looking ofr when visiting the site.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>My Role & Responsibilities</h3>
        <li>Role: UX Designer, UI Designer</li>
        <li>This project was conducted primarily independently with minor collaboration alongside peers conducting similar projects as part of the University of Denver UX/UI Bootcamp. I was responsible for all user research, ideation and definition, prototype creation, testing, and iteration.</li>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Timeline</h3>
        <p>Two weeks.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Tools</h3>
        <p>Figma, FigJam, Canva, Zoom</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>
            The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is the U.S. agency responsible for providing guidance in areas of food, agriculture, natural resources, rural development, and nutrition to the American public. The existing USDA website creates an overwhelming experience for users seeking information on the aforementioned topics. Both the site’s navigational system and page construction are overwhelming for users due to excessive information presented on each screen. As a result, it is unclear where users can find the information they are searching for. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <p>Enhance the navigational system of the site and refine and reorganize the available information to reduce visual clutter and make the user experience more streamlined and simplistic. </p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section class="section">
        <div>
            <h2>User Research & Findings</h2>
            <p>An initial proto persona was created using baseline assumptions regarding the USDA’s work and user population. To validate the assumptions made in teh creation f the proto persona, I conducted five user interviews to determine the true motivation that the average individual would have for visiting the site. The second phase of research consisted of conducting five usability tests with five additional users to assess the current functionality of the site. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Findings</h3>
            <li>User interviews validated that the average user would be visiting the USDA website to find information on a specific topic, for example, a farmer trying to find information on how to apply for a loan or understand which loans are available to them. </li>
            <li>Through usability testing, users expressed an overall sense of frustration with navigating the site because of the overwhelming amount of information on each page, general lack of information organization site-wide, confusion regarding where certain topics would be found, and the inability to navigate back to the primary USDA homepage using intuitive measures like clicking the logo in the top left. </li>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>User Quotes</h3>
            <li>“This website feels like a meme of government efficiency.”</li>
            <li>“If I was actually a rural farmer with no knowledge of government websites, this would be very confusing.”</li>
            <li>“It is exhausting having to make assumptions about where things should be rather than having a clear path to find them.”</li>
        </div>
    </section>
    <section class="section">
        <div>
            <h2>Definition & Ideation</h2>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
            <h3>Feature Prioritization</h3>
            <p>Analysis of the feedback received from users in both interviews and usability testing was written out on sticky notes in FigJam and organized into a feature prioritization matrix ranking items on a scale of importance from high importance to low importance for both users and the USDA. Items categorized as high importance for both parties were then make the priority throughout the prototyping and iteration phases of the project.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
            <h3>Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
            <p>A heuristic evaluation was conducted to further evaluation the core frustrations of excess information and confusing navigation expressed by users during the research phase. Primary determinations included:</p>
            <li>Accessibility can be enhanced by simplifying the way information is displayed.</li>
            <li>Navigation does not function as anticipated</li>
            <li>Progressive disclosure utilized by the site actually does work well to help users find correct information.</li>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
            <h3>Cart Sorting & Stie Mapping</h3>
            <p>I then focused ont eh redevelopment of the site’s navigational structure by conducting an inventory of current navigation items and organizing them through card sorting process. A new site map was created to guide the structure of the navigation redesign. Main navigation included “About Us”, “Topics”, “Resources”, “Media”, and “Policies”.</p>
            <p>Note: Topics and Policies sections intentionally were not given secondary navigational structure because of the excessive amount of information available in these sections.</p>

        <div>
            <h3>Low-Fidelity Wireframe & Prototype</h3>
            <p>Low-fidelity wireframes and prototypes were created for both desktop and responsive mobile designs. Low-Fidelity prototypes were tested with five guerilla tests by users who followed guided tasks to determine the functionality of the site navigation and assess their comfort level with the new informational structure across the various pages.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>User Feedback</h3>
            <li>Some navigation continues to not function as anticipated</li>
            <li>Inconsistency in some elements of page structure were highlighted</li>

            <h3>Style Guide</h3>
            <p>As I moved into the creation of mid- and high- fidelity prototypes, I created a style guide to help direct the design and standardize the feel of the site. The style guide aimed to use some brand colors currently in use by the USDA while incorporating tones such as green which are associated with agriculture and pops of color with yellow which pulls in an association with commonly-grown U.S. crops such as corn and wheat. <br> It was important for the site to still feel like a reputable resource for information provided by experts while bringing in some playful elements and elevating the overall feel.</p>

        <div>
            <h3>Mid-Fidelity Prototype</h3>
            <p>Using the feedback received in the low-fidelity prototyping phase, a first high-fidelity prototype was created, again keeping responsive design for desktop in mobile in mind. An additional seven user tests were conducted to further determine the functionality and user expectations and experience with the product.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
            <h3>User Feedback</h3>
            <li>There is a need for additional navigation systems on the Topics and Policies pages which contain high volumes of information and options in order to streamline information discovery</li>
            <li>Hero image needs to be updated to include more of a call to action</li>
            <li>Site feels crowded with so many colors going on - can be simplified by incorporating more actual white white space</li>
            <li>Clickable area on the cards used for information organization needs to be made larger - some users wanted to click the card directly rather than the CTA on the card and became irritated when they had to click a second time in the right spot</li>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>The progress of this redesign from start to finish was an intellectual challenge in terms of trying to make a government website, which contains so much fvaried and important information, less overwhelming and more navigable for hte everyday user. Having multiple iterations of the design at various stages when combined with user testing helped to create the most usable product possible at this stage, but there is still room for improvement with the way certain elements of the site navigation operate. Overall, it is important to recognize that a project like this one on a site of this scale will always have faults for some users because of the broad range of individuals the USDA has to reach. It is unlikely that as a UX designer you will get every aspect of the user experience right even after multiple sessions of iteration and testing. All you can do is continue to evaluate problems as they come up in the future and work to make it the most accessible site for the broadest population.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Future Priorities</h3>
            <p>If given more time, I would love to focus on conducting some user testing of the final high-fidelity prototype and additional iterations of the site navigation design to get closer to a solution that would function best for the majority of people. Toward the end of the project, some users continued to have questions regarding whey certain information was categorized where it was and I think it would be beneficial to conduct A/B testing in the future to refine these organizational structures.</p>
